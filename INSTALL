To compile 'hobbit', you will need to create a file called 'Makefile.local' 
in the drectory 'src'.  This file contains specifics about your system.
In it you need to specify the locations of the tools you are using.  
In addition you may use the variable 'LOCAL_OPTS' to give additional
options to the compiler.  Mostly these would be CPP directives specifying
what nicities work on your system.  
You may enable each by defining the corresponding symbol.

Nicities:
READLINE    - use the readline library

You may also want to modify the file 'Opts.hs' for additional options.


For example, here is my Makefile.local:

GHC = ghc
ALEX = alex
HAPPY = happy

LOCAL_OPTS = -DREADLINE=1
